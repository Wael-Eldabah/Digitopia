(node:11132) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///C:/Users/WaelAshrafIGRCSQUARE/Desktop/EyeGuard/eyeguard/frontend/postcss.config.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to C:\Users\WaelAshrafIGRCSQUARE\Desktop\EyeGuard\eyeguard\frontend\package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
